# Board game web application clone.
Web application implementing the T3pl game. (I do not know if I can use the name of the game, and if I can create a web application that uses its structure.)

The JS has a number of problems including that there are object not created from the same function: I just repeated the same format; hence it needs to be rewritten to be more robust.
