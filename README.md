# Board game web application clone.
Web application implementing the T3pl game. (I do not know if I can use the name of the game, and if I can create a web application that uses its structure.)

The JS has a number of problems including that there are object not created from the same function: I just repeated the same format; hence it needs to be rewritten to be more robust.

(11 June 2017) Added the last version of the project, that is with the storing to IDB of the game, and the tree management of the game. Note: I have not been working on it since (2 September 2017).
